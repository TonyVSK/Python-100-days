# Rock Paper Scissors Game

The Rock Paper Scissors Game project is a simple Python program that allows users to play the classic game against the computer. It demonstrates the usage of modules, particularly the `randint` function from the `random` module, to generate random choices for the computer. This README emphasizes the importance of modules in simplifying code development and showcases their practical application in creating interactive games.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a single Python file (excepts ascii arts file, of course):
- `main.py`: Contains the main code for running the Rock Paper Scissors game.

## Features

### 1. User Interaction
- Users input their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) via command-line prompts.

### 2. Randomization
- The computer's choice is randomly generated using the `randint` function from the `random` module.

### 3. Game Logic
- The program determines the winner based on the choices made by the user and the computer.
- It displays the chosen options and announces the winner or a tied game.

### 4. Modularization
- ASCII art representations of Rock, Paper, and Scissors are stored in a separate module (`ascii.py`) and imported into the main program.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Input your choice (0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors) when prompted.
3. View the computer's choice and the outcome of the game.

# Higher Lower Game

The Higher Lower Game project is a Python program designed to practice various programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and importing modules. It presents users with pairs of items and challenges them to guess which item has more followers on a social media platform. This README highlights the comprehensive use of programming concepts in the project and reinforces their application in solving real-world problems.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a single Python file:
- `main.py`: Contains the main code for running the Higher Lower Game (excepts ascii arts file, of course).

## Features

### 1. User Interaction
- Users compare two items and guess which one has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B'.

### 2. Randomization
- Items for comparison are randomly selected from a predefined list.

### 3. Game Logic
- The program determines if the user's guess is correct and updates the score accordingly.
- It continues presenting new pairs of items until the user makes an incorrect guess or all items are exhausted.

### 4. ASCII Art
- ASCII art representations of the game's logo, game over message, trophy, versus symbol, and list values are stored in a separate module (`ascii.py`) and imported into the main program.

### 5. Congratulations and Game Over Messages
- Custom messages are displayed to congratulate the user on winning the game or inform them of the game over condition.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Compare the items presented and guess which one has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B'.
3. Continue playing until you make an incorrect guess or win the game.

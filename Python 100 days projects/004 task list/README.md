# Task List Manager

This Python script demonstrates the usage of loop structures (specifically, `while` and `for` loops) to manage a task list. It allows users to input tasks and displays them sequentially with a numbered list.
(While and for structures are very important to programming, so it is necessary to understand how to use then).
## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run the script on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Running the Script

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `task_list_manager.py` file directly.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `task_list_manager.py` file is located.
4. Run the script by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
    ```
    python task_list_manager.py
    ```

## Usage

Follow the prompts to input tasks into the list. You can choose to continue adding tasks or stop when you're done. Once finished, the script will display the list of tasks with a number assigned to each task.

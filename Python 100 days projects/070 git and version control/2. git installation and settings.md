## Installation and Configuration
In this step, our goal is to guide you through installing Git on your operating system and through the initial configuration required to start using Git and GitHub. We'll also go through the process of creating a GitHub account, a crucial component for hosting your projects and collaborating with other developers.

## Git Installation

### Windows:

1. Go to the official Git website (git-scm.com) and download the latest version of Git for Windows.
2. Run the downloaded installation file and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. We recommend leaving the default options unless you have specific needs.
3. After installation, you can check whether it was successful by opening Git Bash, an application that simulates the Linux terminal on Windows.

### macOS:

1. Git can be installed on macOS using Homebrew, a package manager. If you don't already have Homebrew, install it by running /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" in the terminal.
2. With Homebrew installed, run brew install git to install Git.
3. Verify the installation with git --version.

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

1. Open the terminal and run sudo apt update to update the package list.
2. Install Git with sudo apt install git.
3. Verify the installation with git --version.

## Creating a GitHub Account

1. Go to github.com.
2. Click “Sign up” in the top right corner of the page.
3. Fill in the form with your username, email and password. Follow the instructions to verify your account and complete the creation process.

### Initial Git Setup
To personalize your Git experience, it's important to set up your username and email address. That's because every Git commit uses this information, and it's permanently embedded in the commits you initiate.

1. Open the terminal (or Git Bash on Windows).
2. Configure your username with git config --global user.name "Your Name".
3. Configure your email address with git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com".

### Checking the Configuration:

* To check your settings, run git config --list.
* If you need to make any changes, simply run the configuration commands again.

Now that you've set up Git and created your GitHub account, you're ready to start using these powerful tools to manage your code projects!

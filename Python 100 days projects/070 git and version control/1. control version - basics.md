## History and Importance of Version Control
Version control is a practice of managing changes to documents, programs, and other information stored as digital files. Allowing multiple versions of a set of documents to be stored and accessed when necessary. It arose from the need to organize and control changes made to software source codes. Before version control systems (VCS), developers had difficulty tracking changes and collaborating on software projects. With the evolution of technology, tools like Git have become essential to facilitate collaboration, maintain change histories, and allow teams to work simultaneously on different features of the same project without conflicts.


## Differences between Git and GitHub
Git is a distributed version control system, focused on speed, efficiency with large projects, and support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches). It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel. Git allows developers to work locally, making commits, branches, and merges on their own machines before sharing the work with others.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based code hosting platform that uses Git for version control. In addition to storing code repositories, GitHub offers additional functionality such as pull requests, project management, continuous integration, and a social community for developers to share projects and collaborate. GitHub makes the collaboration process more accessible and manageable, especially for large projects.

## Basic Git Vocabulary
* Commit: A commit is a recording of changes made to the repository. It's like a snapshot of your project, allowing you to return to that point in the future.
* Branch: A branch is a separate version of the repository, generally used to develop a specific functionality. This allows you to work on changes without affecting the main branch (often called "master" or "main").
* Merge: The merge action incorporates changes from one branch into another. It is commonly used to update the main branch with changes developed in a separate branch.
* Pull: The pull command is used to update the local repository with the changes made in the remote repository on GitHub.
* Push: Pushing is the process of sending your local changes to a remote repository, making them accessible to other contributors.
* Fork: A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
* Clone: ​​Cloning is the act of copying a GitHub repository to your local computer, allowing you to work on the project offline.

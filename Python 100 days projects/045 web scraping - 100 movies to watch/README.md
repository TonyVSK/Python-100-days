# ## 100 Movies that You Must Watch: Empire Online Best Movies Scraper

This Python script scrapes data from a web archive of Empire Online's "Best Movies" webpage and extracts movie titles to a text file.

## Overview

The script accesses a snapshot of Empire Online's webpage from the Internet Archive and extracts the titles of the best movies featured on the page.

## Functionality

1. **Web Scraping**:
   - Utilizes the `requests` library to retrieve the HTML content of the archived webpage.
   - Parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup (`bs4`) to extract movie titles.

2. **Data Extraction**:
   - Finds all `<h3>` elements with the class `title`, which typically contain movie titles.
   - Extracts the text of these elements to obtain a list of movie titles.

3. **Writing to File**:
   - Writes the extracted movie titles to a text file named `movies.txt`, with each title on a separate line.

## Running the Script

1. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed, including `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
2. Update the `URL` variable with the link to the desired webpage or archive snapshot.
3. Run the script to initiate the scraping and writing process.

## Output

The script generates a text file named `movies.txt`, which contains a list of movie titles extracted from the specified webpage or archive snapshot.

## Limitations

- The script relies on the specific structure and class names of the HTML elements on the webpage. Changes to the webpage structure may require modifications to the script.
- Ensure ethical use of web scraping techniques and comply with the terms of service of the website being scraped.

# Turtle Race Betting

The Turtle Race Betting project introduces the concept of event-driven programming and user interaction by simulating a turtle race where users can place bets on the winning turtle. Users are prompted to select a turtle color and place their bet before the race begins. Once the race starts, turtles move randomly, and the winner's color is announced at the end of the race.

## Event-Driven Programming and User Interaction

Event-driven programming is utilized to handle user input and control the flow of the race. Users interact with the program by selecting a turtle color and placing their bets. The program then simulates the race, providing feedback on the outcome based on the user's bet. The project offers an engaging and interactive experience for users, combining elements of gaming and betting.

## Key Features

### 1. Turtle Race Simulation
- Six turtles of different colors participate in the race, each starting from the same position.
- Turtles move forward randomly, simulating a race where the fastest turtle wins.
- The race continues until one turtle reaches the finish line.

### 2. User Bet Placement
- Users are prompted to select a turtle color and place their bets before the race begins.
- The program accepts user input for the chosen turtle color and checks against the winning turtle color at the end of the race.

### 3. Outcome Display
- Once the race is complete and a winner is determined, the program displays the winning turtle's color.
- If the user's bet matches the winning turtle's color, a congratulatory message is shown. Otherwise, a message indicating the loss is displayed.

## How to Use the Turtle Race Betting Program

1. Run the Python script (`main.py`) in a Python environment.
2. A window will appear displaying the turtle race track and prompt users to select a turtle color for betting.
3. Enter the desired turtle color (e.g., red, orange, yellow) when prompted.
4. Wait for the race to begin and observe the turtles moving forward randomly.
5. Once a turtle crosses the finish line, the winning turtle's color is announced.
6. If the user's bet matches the winning turtle's color, a congratulatory message is displayed. Otherwise, a message indicating the loss is shown.
7. Close the window by clicking anywhere on the screen.

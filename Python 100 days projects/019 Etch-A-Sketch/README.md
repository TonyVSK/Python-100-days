# Turtle Graphics Control Panel

The Turtle Graphics Control Panel project introduces the concept of event-driven programming and user interaction by creating a control panel for a Turtle graphics application. Users can control the movement of a Turtle object on the screen using keyboard input, allowing for dynamic and interactive drawing experiences.

## Event-Driven Programming and User Interaction

Event-driven programming is a paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, system notifications, or sensor inputs. In this project, keyboard events trigger specific actions in the program, enabling users to interact with the Turtle graphics application in real-time. Users can control the movement of the Turtle by pressing keys on the keyboard, providing a hands-on experience in creating drawings and designs.

## Key Features

### 1. Movement Control
- Users can control the movement of the Turtle object using the W, A, S, and D keys.
- Pressing the W key moves the Turtle forward, A key turns the Turtle left, D key turns the Turtle right, and S key moves the Turtle backward.

### 2. Clear Functionality
- Provides a clear function (activated by the C key) to reset the drawing canvas and return the Turtle to its starting position.
- Clears any existing drawings on the screen and allows users to start fresh with their creations.

### 3. Interactive Drawing
- Offers an interactive drawing experience where users can experiment with different movements and shapes.
- Encourages creativity and exploration by providing immediate feedback to user actions.

## How to Use the Control Panel

1. Run the Python script (`main.py`) in a Python environment.
2. A Turtle graphics window will appear on the screen.
3. Use the keyboard to control the movement of the Turtle:
   - Press W to move forward.
   - Press A to turn left.
   - Press D to turn right.
   - Press S to move backward.
   - Press C to clear the canvas and reset the Turtle position.
4. Experiment with different key combinations to create drawings and designs.
5. Close the window by clicking anywhere on the screen.

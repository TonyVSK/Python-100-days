# Simple Calculator

The Simple Calculator project is a basic Python program that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It showcases the use of conditional statements (ifs and elses) to determine the operation to be performed based on user input. This README emphasizes the importance of conditional statements in programming and highlights the project's suitability for beginner-level programming education.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a single Python file:
- `main.py`: Contains the main code for running the calculator and performing arithmetic operations.

## Features

### 1. Arithmetic Operations
- The calculator can perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

### 2. User Interaction
- Users input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.
- The program then calculates and displays the result.

### 3. Conditional Statements
- Conditional statements (ifs and elses) are used to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on user input.

### 4. Looping
- After calculating a result, users can choose to continue using that result in subsequent calculations or start a new calculation.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Follow the prompts to input two numbers and choose an operation.
3. View the calculated result.
4. Choose whether to continue using the result in further calculations or start a new calculation.

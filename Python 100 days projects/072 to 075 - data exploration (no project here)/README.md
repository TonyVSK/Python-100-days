# Folder 072 and 073: Understanding Data Exploration with Pandas

In this folder we don't have a specific project, the 100 days of code class is focused on learning some online tools to use python and ork with some modules, such as pandas.
So I decided to explain about it

## Google Colab Notebook

Also known as Google Colab, it is a free online tool in the cloud that allows us to write and run Python code through the browser. It is a very useful tool for developers and data scientists as it offers free access to high-performance computing resources. It is the tool we will use throughout the course.

### Join Colab

You will need to log in to Google Colab through Google Drive. There, go to New → More → Google Colaboratory.
When you open Google Colab, you will notice that the tool is divided into cells. To execute a cell: Shift + Enter

### Sending

With the csv file in this folder, move and drop it into the Google Colab sidebar to start working. So, with the file in our online repository, we need to import our module and read our file:
```bash
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('salários_por_faculdade_major.csv')
```

To see the first 5 lines of the file, just use the df.head() command


And that's it! Now we can manipulate our data online, with this tool.


Basically, the course sugests to use 2 csv files to make some data analysis, one for day 072, and another one for 073.
The 072 is salarues_by_college_major.csv
the 073 is QueryResults.csv




## Folder 074

Inside this folder, we have the day 074 folders, the idea is  deep into a dataset all about LEGO, to see how to get informations about, for example, history of lego, product offering etc.

### Idea - what to learn with 074
* How to combine a Notebook with HTML Markup.

* Apply Python List slicing techniques to Pandas DataFrames.

* How to aggregate data using the .agg() function.

* How to create scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts with two axes in Matplotlib.

* Understand database schemas that are organised by primary and foreign keys.

* How to merge DataFrames that share a common key

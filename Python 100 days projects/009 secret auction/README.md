# Auction Winner

The Auction Winner project is a Python program that facilitates a simple auction where individuals can place bids. It features interactive user input, data storage, and winner determination. This README highlights the use of ASCII art, the `replit` module for screen clearing, data manipulation using dictionaries and lists, and control flow using loops and conditional statements.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a single Python file:
- `main.py`: Contains the main code for running the auction and determining the winner.

## Features

### 1. Interactive Auction
- Users are prompted to input their name and bid.
- The program stores each bidder's information in a list of dictionaries.

### 2. ASCII Art
- ASCII art of a hammer is displayed at the beginning of the auction to enhance user experience.

### 3. Winner Determination
- After all bids are submitted, the program determines the winner based on the highest bid.

### 4. Screen Clearing
- The `replit` module is used to clear the screen between interactions, providing a clean user interface.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Follow the prompts to input bidder information.
3. Once all bids are submitted, the program will display the winner.

## Example

```
What is your name?
Alice
What is your bid?
$100
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.
yes

What is your name?
Bob
What is your bid?
$150
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.

The winner is Bob with a bid of $150

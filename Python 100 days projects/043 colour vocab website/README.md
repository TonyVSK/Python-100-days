# Colour Vocab Website

This project is designed to help you learn about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) by styling a simple webpage that teaches colors in Spanish.

## Overview

The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`style.css`). The HTML file contains headings for different colors in Spanish along with corresponding images. The CSS file is used to style the elements in the HTML file according to the provided instructions.

### HTML Structure

- **Colors**: Heading indicating the topic of the webpage.
- **Learn the colors in Spanish!**: Subheading providing context.
- **Color Titles and Images**: Each color is represented by a heading (`<h2>`) with its name in Spanish and an image.

### CSS Styling

1. **External Stylesheet**: The CSS file (`style.css`) is linked to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.
2. **Styling Color Titles**:
   - The class `.color-title` is used to style all color titles.
   - Each color title is styled according to its respective color using their unique IDs (`#red`, `#blue`, `#orange`, `#green`, `#yellow`).
3. **Font Weight**:
   - All color titles have their font weight set to normal using the `.color-title` class.
4. **Image Size**:
   - All images are set to have a height and width of 200px using CSS.

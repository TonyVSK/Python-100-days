# U.S. States Game - Data Analysis with Pandas

This repository contains a Python script that serves as an educational tool for learning U.S. states' names and their locations on a map. The script utilizes the Pandas library for data analysis and the Turtle library for visual representation.

## Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- **`main.py`**: The main Python script responsible for running the U.S. States Game.
- **`50_states.csv`**: A CSV file containing data about the U.S. states, including their names, x and y coordinates for positioning on the map.
- **`blank_states_img.gif`**: An image file representing the blank map of the U.S. states.

## How It Works

1. The script reads the data from the CSV file using Pandas, extracting the names of all 50 U.S. states.
2. It then prompts the user to input the names of the states they know.
3. The script checks the user's input against the list of states. If the input matches a state name, the script displays the name of the state on the map.
4. The user continues to input state names until they have correctly identified all 50 states or choose to exit the program.

## Running the Game

To run the U.S. States Game:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.
4. Run the `main.py` script using Python: `python main.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the names of U.S. states.
6. Close the game window when finished.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.11
- Pandas library
- Turtle library

## Notes

- The game allows users to test their knowledge of U.S. states' names and locations in a fun and interactive way.
- Users can exit the game at any time by typing "Exit" when prompted for a state name.
